rewards_groupName: Rewards
rewards_groupDesc: |
  Note for TR/PT enjoyers!

  Current defaults are intended for factions in just one region (vanilla faction questlines average ~30 quests).
  If you plan to play both Vvardenfell and Mainland guild questlines, I'd strongly suggest adjusting these values for obvious reasons.
